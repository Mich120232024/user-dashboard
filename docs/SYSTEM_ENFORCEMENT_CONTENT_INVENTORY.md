## Summary Statistics

- **Total Files Reviewed**: ~200+
- **ACTIVE**: ~80 files (40%)
- **ARCHIVE**: ~90 files (45%)
- **REVIEW**: ~30 files (15%)

## Recommendations for HEAD_OF_RESEARCH

1. **Priority Review Items**:
   - All files marked [REVIEW] in /research/ directory
   - Market intelligence and AI research documents
   - Alternative methodologies documentation
   - Recent notes that may contain strategic insights

2. **Consolidation Opportunities**:
   - Merge duplicate agent initialization prompts
   - Combine multiple workspace structure documents
   - Consolidate audit methodologies

3. **Archive Strategy**:
   - Move all [ARCHIVE] content to dedicated archive directory
   - Maintain searchable index of archived content
   - Set retention policy for different archive types

4. **Migration Priority**:
   - Core documents and constitutional framework (Priority 1)
   - Active operational guides and methods (Priority 2)
   - Current audit methodologies and templates (Priority 3)
   - Research and review items (Priority 4)

**Next Steps**: 
1. HEAD_OF_RESEARCH to review all [REVIEW] items
2. Confirm classification decisions
3. Proceed with migration of [ACTIVE] content to new documentation system
4. Archive [ARCHIVE] content appropriately
