## 1. Audit Summary

A static analysis of the backend codebase for the User Dashboard project was performed. The investigation revealed several critical misconfigurations that are the most likely cause of the "Not Found" error observed on the frontend. The primary issues are a **port mismatch** between the frontend and backend, and **missing core dependencies** in the project's `pyproject.toml` file.

**Key Finding:** The backend server, when started with the provided `dev.sh` script, will fail to launch correctly due to missing dependencies and is configured to run on the wrong port (`8000` instead of `8001`), preventing the frontend from connecting to it.

## 2. Code & Configuration Analysis

### 2.1. Inferred Technology Stack
- **Framework:** FastAPI
- **Server:** Uvicorn
- **Dependency Management:** Poetry
- **Application Entry Point:** `Engineering Workspace/Projects/user-dashboard/backend/app/main.py`
- **Startup Script:** `Engineering Workspace/Projects/user-dashboard/dev.sh`

### 2.2. Dependency Analysis (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Status:** ❌ **Critical Failure**
- **Details:** The `pyproject.toml` file for the root workspace is missing the core dependencies required to run the FastAPI backend.
- **Missing Packages:**
    - `fastapi`: The web framework itself.
    - `uvicorn`: The ASGI server used to run the application.
- **Impact:** The `poetry install` command in the `dev.sh` script will not install these packages. As a result, the `poetry run uvicorn ...` command will fail instantly with a "command not found" error.

### 2.3. Startup Script Analysis (`dev.sh`)
- **Status:** ❌ **Critical Failure**
- **Details:** The `dev.sh` script contains two major issues:
    1.  **Port Mismatch:** The script explicitly starts the backend on port `8000`:
        ```bash
        poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
        ```
        However, the frontend application at `http://localhost:8080/` is hardcoded to make API calls to `http://localhost:8001`. The backend is running on a different port than the frontend expects.
    2.  **Incorrect Working Directory:** The `dev.sh` script correctly navigates into the `backend` directory before running `poetry install` and `poetry run uvicorn`. However, the root `pyproject.toml` is the one missing the dependencies. This suggests a potential misconfiguration in the project structure, where the backend might need its own `pyproject.toml`.

## 3. Conclusion & Recommendations

The backend is failing due to a combination of missing dependencies and a port mismatch. The server process is likely crashing immediately upon execution of the `dev.sh` script.

**Immediate Actionable Recommendations:**

1.  **Add Core Dependencies:** Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn` to your project's dependencies. Since you are using Poetry, you can navigate to the `Engineering Workspace/Projects/user-dashboard/backend` directory and run:
    ```bash
    # It's better to have a dedicated pyproject.toml for the backend
    # If not, add these to the root pyproject.toml
    poetry add fastapi uvicorn
    ```

2.  **Correct the Port Number:** Modify the `dev.sh` script to run the backend on the correct port that the frontend expects (`8001`).
    - **File:** `Engineering Workspace/Projects/user-dashboard/dev.sh`
    - **Change this line:**
      ```bash
      poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &
      ```
    - **To this:**
      ```bash
      poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 &
      ```
    - Also, update the informational echo statements in the script to reflect the correct port.

3.  **Verify Environment Configuration:**
    - After fixing the dependencies and port, inspect the `backend/.env.example` file. Copy it to `.env` if it doesn't exist, and ensure all required environment variables (like database connection strings, API keys, etc.) are correctly filled in. An incomplete configuration in the `.env` file can also cause startup failures.

After implementing these changes, run the `dev.sh` script again and check the terminal for any errors. If the backend starts successfully, the frontend at `http://localhost:8080/` should be able to connect to it.
